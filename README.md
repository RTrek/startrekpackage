``` r
devtools::install_github("Rtrek/startrekpackage")
```

Notes
-----

I have filtered the spoken words of the main characters from the rest of the script. If you would like all sentances in every episode spoken by everyone, you have to use the data from [here](https://github.com/RTrek/TNG "data only")

Code that created the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/RTrek/startrekTNGdataset "contains code")

Kind regards, Roel.
