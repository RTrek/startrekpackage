call functions with the name of the characters
`Picard()` , `Geordi()`, etc

```{r}
library(startrek)
Picard()
Guinan()
```
## Installation
This package is not on cran. Nor should it be.
install with:
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("Rtrek/startrekpackage")
```

## Notes
I have filtered the spoken words of the main characters from the rest of the script.
If you would like all sentances in every episode spoken by 
everyone, you have to use the data from [here](https://github.com/RTrek/TNG "data only")

Code that created the dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/RTrek/startrekTNGdataset "contains code")

## Errors, help, great ideas or comments?

sending me a pull request (PR)
or emailing me. 

Kind regards,
Roel.
