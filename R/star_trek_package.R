#' Star Trek Package
#'
#' This package will give you: for every main character
#' in the Star Trek the Next Generation (TNG) a random
#' selection of phrases. All the phrases have been
#' lifted from the original Scripts.
#'
#' All functions are called after the Character. So
#' just call Pulaski() Or Picard().
#'
#' This is where you should actually put a link or something
#' to the original source of the document and the dataset.
